# Node + Express + Express Templates ARE BUSTED!

## Task

* Find all the errors in the code and fix them so the app runs
* There are _multiple_ errors (~15 of them). The app won't run intil they're _all_ fixed.
* As you make it through one error, be on the lookout for the next one.
* __ALL__ files are in play.

## Getting started

* First, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
* Then run `npm run dev` to start the app.
* Start fixing!
